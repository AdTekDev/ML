# Seminar

## Requirements

1. **Purpose & Application** – Explain what the algorithm is designed for (classification, regression, clustering, etc.) and give at least one real-world use case.

2. **Core Principle & Processing Flow** – Describe the key idea of how the algorithm works, including the main steps from input → processing → output.

3. **Algorithm Details & Model Representation** – Present the algorithm logic (pseudo-code, formula, or diagram) and clarify how the learned model is stored/represented (e.g., weights, trees, clusters, matrices).

4. **Strengths & Limitations** – Identify the main advantages, disadvantages, and suitable/unsuitable contexts for the algorithm.

5. **Complexity & Key Parameters** – Discuss computational complexity and highlight the most influential hyperparameters.

6. **Evaluation Metrics** – Indicate which performance metrics are commonly used to assess the algorithm (e.g., accuracy, RMSE, AUC).
